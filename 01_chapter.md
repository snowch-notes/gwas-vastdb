**I. Introduction to Genetics and GWAS**

**1.1. What is DNA, Genes, and Genomes?**

* **DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid): The Blueprint of Life:**
    * DNA is the molecule that carries the genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all known organisms.
    * It's structured as a double helix, resembling a twisted ladder.
    * The "rungs" of the ladder are made up of pairs of chemical compounds called nucleotides or bases: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G). A always pairs with T, and C always pairs with G.
    * The sequence of these bases along the DNA molecule encodes the genetic information.
* **Genes: Functional Units of Heredity:**
    * A gene is a specific segment of DNA that contains the instructions for building a particular protein or RNA molecule.
    * Proteins are the workhorses of the cell, carrying out a vast array of functions.
    * Genes are the basic units of heredity, passed from parents to offspring.
* **Chromosomes: Organized DNA Structures:**
    * In eukaryotic cells (like human cells), DNA is organized into structures called chromosomes.
    * Each chromosome is a long, continuous strand of DNA tightly coiled around proteins.
    * Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes (46 total): 22 pairs of autosomes and 1 pair of sex chromosomes (XX for females, XY for males).
* **The Human Genome: The Complete Set of Genetic Instructions:**
    * The genome is the complete set of genetic material in an organism.
    * The human genome consists of approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA.
    * The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, sequenced and mapped the entire human genome, providing a foundational resource for genetic research.

**1.2. Genetic Variation: SNPs and Alleles**

* **Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs): The Most Common Type of Genetic Variation:**
    * SNPs are variations in a single nucleotide base at a specific position in the genome.
    * For example, at a particular location, some individuals might have an "A" base, while others have a "C" base.
    * SNPs are the most common type of genetic variation, accounting for the majority of differences between individuals.
    * They can occur anywhere in the genome, including within genes and in the regions between genes.
* **Alleles: Different Versions of a Gene or SNP:**
    * An allele is one of two or more versions of a gene or SNP.
    * For example, if a SNP has two possible bases (A or C), then "A" and "C" are the two alleles for that SNP.
    * Individuals inherit one allele from each parent for each gene or SNP.
* **Genotypes: The Combination of Alleles an Individual Carries:**
    * A genotype is the specific combination of alleles an individual has at a particular genetic locus (location).
    * For a SNP with two alleles (e.g., A and C), there are three possible genotypes: AA, AC, and CC.
    * Genotypes determine an individual's genetic makeup at specific locations in the genome.

**1.3. What is a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS)?**

* **The Goal of GWAS: Identifying Genetic Associations with Traits or Diseases:**
    * GWAS aims to discover genetic variants (typically SNPs) that are associated with specific traits or diseases.
    * It seeks to understand how genetic variation contributes to individual differences in susceptibility to diseases or variations in traits.
* **How GWAS Works: Analyzing Millions of SNPs Across Large Populations:**
    * GWAS involves genotyping (determining the genotypes of) millions of SNPs in a large group of individuals.
    * These individuals are typically divided into two groups: those with the trait or disease of interest (cases) and those without it (controls).
    * Statistical analyses are performed to identify SNPs that are significantly more common in cases than in controls.
    * Statistical significance is very important in GWAS, because of the large number of tests performed.
* **Phenotypes: Traits or Diseases Being Studied:**
    * A phenotype is any observable characteristic or trait of an organism, such as height, weight, eye color, or disease status.
    * GWAS aims to identify genetic variations that are associated with specific phenotypes.

**1.4. The Importance of Large Datasets in GWAS**

* **Why Large Sample Sizes are Crucial for Statistical Power:**
    * GWAS involves testing millions of SNPs, which requires very high statistical power to detect true associations and avoid false positives.
    * Large sample sizes increase statistical power, making it more likely to detect subtle genetic effects.
    * Small effect sizes are common in GWAS, so large sample sizes are needed to find those small effects.
* **The Resulting Data Volume: Millions of SNPs x Thousands of Individuals:**
    * GWAS generates massive amounts of data, as millions of SNPs are genotyped in thousands or even hundreds of thousands of individuals.
    * This data volume poses significant challenges for storage, processing, and analysis.
    * The large amount of data is one of the main reasons that specialized databases like VAST DB are needed.
